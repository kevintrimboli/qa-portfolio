# Jira Workflows (Quick Notes)

A workflow defines the states a work item can move through.

## Common Bug workflow
- **To Do / New** → **In Progress** → **In Review** → **Done**
- Optional states:
  - **Blocked**
  - **Reopened**
  - **Won't Fix**

## Why it matters
- Teams need a shared process
- Status tells where the item is in the lifecycle
- Helps reporting (lead time, throughput)

## Sprint visibility
If an issue isn't visible on the board, it may not be assigned to a Sprint or the board filter.
Adding it to an active Sprint typically makes it visible.
