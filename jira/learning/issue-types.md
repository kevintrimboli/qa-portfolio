# Jira Issue Types (Quick Notes)

## Bug
A defect where the actual behavior differs from expected behavior.

## Story
A feature requirement described from user perspective.

## Task
Work that needs to be done (often smaller than a story).

## Epic
A large body of work that groups multiple stories/tasks.

## Sub-task
A smaller unit linked under a parent issue.

## Practical tip (portfolio)
Use:
- **Bug** for defects you find
- **Task** for documentation work
- **Epic** only if you want to group multiple bugs/projects (optional)
